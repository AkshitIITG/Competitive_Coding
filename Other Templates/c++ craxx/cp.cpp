I m feeling a bit too restless these days.
I just wanna make somethings clear
I know its tough to decide and teri choices bhi badi jaldi change hoti hai
but its better ki abhi hi sab clear hojaye.
maybe I dont like you maybe I do I dunno.
I just want to get over this addiction kuch bhi karke.
I have wasted my first yr abb nd dont think its coz of you its all my fault I got fucking addicted
to texting you every now and then.
you are the most loveliest person I have met,wanted to spend more time with you.
but never got a chance
I feel so impotent
I never get what I think I deserve
Every fucking material thing I bought is just to have some materialistic happiness.
over this last year I have being fooling my parents and well wishers(if any)
wanted to atleat 2K in cf
wanted to date you sometime
wanted a 10 spi in sem 1
wanted 9.8+ cpi
didnt get any
its not like I wasnt capable but this one thing kept holding me back
that is my infatuation for you (maybe love dunno)
And maybe you and pratyush can get back together things would get better
u would forget me quite easily
Once you start thinking negative about a person then waisa hi continue hota
Now we are into sem 3 unargubaly the toughest sem I want to get a perfect 10
and restore my charm SIR TEJAS lol
I want everything that I missed in last year
Thanks for teaching me so many life lessons
Sometimes I think If we continue this way I may need to go to a rehab.
I cant keep waiting for you so long
Just tell me what you feel
why do you keep talking to other boys ,girl it would just waste your time
People call me emotionless lol
but m the first one who cries
cried a lot because of my insecurities for you.
Now I have nothing except those materialistic things
chal gn beautiful
take care
